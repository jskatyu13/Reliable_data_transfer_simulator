# Reliable_data_transfer_simulator
This reliable data transfer simulation program contains 
an Alternating-Bit Protocol (ABP) mode and 
a Go-Back-N protocol (GBN) mode.  Both protocols are 
implemented in a predefined simulator by J.F.Kurose.  
The user could select the simulation mode (1 for ABP, 
2 for GBN) before entering specific testing parameters.  

The detailed program design is described in a design 
document and the sample output for ABP and GBN are shown 
in the design document with color labeling.
